# CMP637-Starter-Templates
This repository contains a list of starter templates for the programming assignments in the CMP637 Deep Generative Modelling Course offered in Cairo University, Faculty of Engineering.

## Templates

The templates can be found in the folder `Notebooks`. The following templates currently exist:
- [MNIST.ipynb](Notebooks/MNIST.ipynb): A template for working with the MNIST handwritten digit dataset. You can choose to load the dataset in a discrete (channels are `uint8`) or continuous (channels are `float32`) by setting the variable `use_discrete_data`.
- [CIFAR10.ipynb](Notebooks/CIFAR10.ipynb): A template for working with the CIFAR10 dataset. You can choose to load the dataset in a discrete (channels are `uint8`) or continuous (channels are `float32`) by setting the variable `use_discrete_data`.

## Usage

The template were written with **Google Colab** in mind, but you can still run them locally if you install the required libraries.
